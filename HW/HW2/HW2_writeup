In Streamlit, what happens when you define and click the defined button:

align_clicked = st.button("▶️ Align sequences")

Answer:  When the user clicks the button, Streamlit reruns the entire script from the top, 
and align_clicked becomes True for that run, allowing the code inside if align_clicked: to execute.


Why do we use:

st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

Answer:  It makes the chart automatically scale to fit the available page width.
