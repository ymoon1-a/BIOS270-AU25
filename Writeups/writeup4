How could one add a differential expression analysis (DESeq2) step to the rnaseq_pipeline_array_depend.sh script such that DESeq2 
runs only after all salmon jobs for all samples have completed? (No code required - describe conceptually)

1. Use a “job dependency” on the array job
Most schedulers (SLURM especially) allow you to submit a job and make it wait for another job (or array) to finish:
Submit the array job for Salmon
Capture its job ID
Submit the DESeq2 job with something like:

--dependency=afterok:<array_job_id>

The array job ID represents all the tasks in the array.
“afterok” ensures the DESeq2 step launches only when every array task finishes without failure.
Conceptual workflow
Submit Salmon job array → this launches N jobs
Scheduler tracks them and waits until every array element finishes
Only then, scheduler triggers the DESeq2 job

2. Create a separate script for DESeq2 and chain it
Your rnaseq_pipeline_array_depend.sh would:
Submit the Salmon array job
Extract the job ID from sbatch
Use that ID to submit the DESeq2 job with a dependency
This allows the pipeline to run fully automated while maintaining proper ordering.
